# Bike Sharing Study
## Summery
This challenge analyzes the New York Citi Bike program, and studies the feasibility of a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, IA.

## Study
The most import factor in bike sharing is the wide usage. Based this study, Des Moines could have 144,000 bike rides per month, a bike-sharing program there should be successful.

The study is saved in Tableau Public Server. It could be viewd here: [Bike Sharing Study](https://public.tableau.com/profile/chang6682#!/vizhome/Challenge_15872781858020/Story?publish=yes).
Following are page by page story explaination.

## Story
The bicycle-sharing has changed many cities in the world. It reduces the traffic congestion, reduces pollution and provides an alternative convenient public transport. While it charges user fees in many places, it is also financed by volunteer work, government subsidies, advertisement, etc. A successful bike-sharing program must be widely used in the serving communities, which enables all finance sources.

New York Citi Bike is one of such successful programs. It recorded 2,344,224 ridership in August 2018. Most of its riders are young adults. Its users include subscribers, and paid per-use customers.

Des Moines, IA is a smaller city compared to New York. To estimate Des Moines subscription-based bike ridership, we use the ratio of the two cities residents between ages 18 years and 65 years. From census data, the calculation says that every 100 subscription based Citi Bike riders should have 2.53 subscription based rides in Des Moines. To estimate the paid per use customers in Des Moine, we would use the visitor ratio between the two cities. From wikipedia and catchdesmoines.com, Des Moines has about 21.82% of visitors as of New York.  With these numbers, we get Des Moines's ridership projection. The average monthly temperature comes from NOAA, December, January and February may not be warm enough for people to ride a bike. 

The following story page illustrates the projected rides in each hour, and in each day in a month, per gender and customer type.

To illustrate community disruption due to bike-sharing, a simulated Des Moine Map is given. The New York bike station map is first moved to Des Moine, then scales down according to the city's area sizes, adjusting to the projected usages, and finally sample the bike usage with the same intervals. The two maps are given with the same color scale. Overall, the impact is small, the heaviest used cell may register 16,000 rides per month, compared to 100,000 rides with the same cell size in New York.

Des Moines could have 144,000 bike records per month. It should roll out a bike-sharing program.

The "dashboard" covers the important parts of the story.
